# Onboarding_self
-----07/10 given approval to work as project but no free time 

This is a simple forms tool with basic steps to allow onboarding to deal with simple calls. 

This is in hopes to make trivial questions not take up too much space. 

this will also help rule out the panicking scenario due to the structure of the form. 

------07/31 been really busy with work
added the JS section 
needs alot of work 
have the basics for some JS


This is a working progress.....
